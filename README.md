# RemoteSensor
This Project is about a sensor Platform for our Weekendhome.

* The Brain of the Project will be a Raspberry Pi Pico running CircuitPython. 
* For the first Version i will be using a BME280 for monitoring the air pressure, inside Temperature and Humidity.
* A second Temperature Sensor monitoring the outside Air temperature is not specified yet (i was thinking about a DHT22, but when i started it was not supported by CP)
* Future Sensor Options also include a Brightnes sensor.
* For communication i am using a SIM800L module that transmits to my webserver.
